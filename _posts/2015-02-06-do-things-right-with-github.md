I was staring at my github page, wondering why I created those open-source projects and was never expecting anyone to benefit from them.

<!-- more -->

Finally I figured out that those projects were not really Open-Source projects. They were just pieces of code I put together and pushed up to repositories along with a MIT license . They were even not finished with an available release. Sometimes I thought they were toys. But now I know for sure that they are just garbage.

There was a time when I was pround of those projects. They  helped me get my first job. They were like badges indicating my capabilities with languages and tools and really nice coding conventions.

But those feelings were gone not very long ago 'cause  none of those projects could be used in production environment or offer the value of study. That's why I am going to delete those projects. I don't want to pollute the Internet anymore. It's time to stop making noise and create things that really meaning something.
